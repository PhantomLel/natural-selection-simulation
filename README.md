# Natural Selection Simulator

This is a simulator for showing how organisms with higher fitnesses survive and take up the majority of the gene pool

In each folder under variations, I have put some situations that I thought produced cool outcomes. 

When the simulation ends, a graph is created showing some statistics that I thought would be interesting to see.
